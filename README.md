# UCT Radio Astronomy Interferometry Project

## Description
This project focuses on the design and development of a two-element radio interferometer system for the Department of Astronomy at the University of Cape Town (UCT). The system serves as both a research and educational tool for demonstrating fundamental interferometric principles and performing real astronomical observations.

## Repository Structure
* **Direction Finding Experiment** â€” Contains the code used for the direction-finding experiment.  
* **Final Interferometry Software** â€” The main directory of the repository. It includes all source files and the Windows executable for the final interferometer control and visualization interface developed for the UCT Department of Astronomy.  
* **Instrumental Calibration (03 Oct)** â€” Contains the code used in the telescope calibration process.  
* **Main Observation (03 Oct)** â€” Includes the scripts used to perform the solar observation and the code for data analysis.  
* **Pluto Phase Stability Test** â€” Contains the code developed to evaluate the phase stability of the Pluto Software-Defined Radio (SDR).  
* **Simulations Code** â€” Contains simulation scripts that demonstrate interferometric concepts and test various signal processing techniques.  
* **UV Maps Simulations** â€” Includes Jupyter Notebook scripts for visualizing UV coverage maps.

## Language
All software and scripts were developed using **Python**.
